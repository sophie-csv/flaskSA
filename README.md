This is a front-end web development for my sentiment analysis classification for resturant reviews program. This project is using the TextBlob polarity classifier to apply ABSA (Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis). This will allow users to enter in a CSV dataset and output downloadable data visualizations of text sentiment. Users may also be able to custom select the aspects they choose to use. This project is still a work in progress.
